<h1>E-commerce Games Shop</h1>
<p>Online shop which allows customers to purchase some games. On the website customer is able to manage his shopping cart (adding, removing, editing or buying products). There
are also features like browsing all game in the store or searching specific games by category. Customer can create and log in to his account and may change his personal data, delete his account or controlling his transactions by tracking the table of his made purchases. Customers have possibility to look for goods in an asynchronous way using search engine. There are also two additional modes to log in to the service: employee of the website who can edit all games in the store and manage all transactions; administrator of the site who deals with employees. Website includes Google Recaptcha so bots won't fill up the database with the fake data and also there is JWT feature which assures that the user is really who he is.
